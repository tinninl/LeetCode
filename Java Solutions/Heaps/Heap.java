/**
 * A Heap is a tree-based DS where the tree is a complete binary tree 
 * All levels are filled, except maybe the bottom level, which is filled left to right
 * 
 * Max Heap: root is greater than all children
 * Min Heap: root is less than all children
 * 
 * Operations
 * 1. Heapify: turn an array into a heap
 * 2. Insertion
 * 3. Deletion
 * 4. Peek: look at top element, root
 * 
 * Parent childen relationship is:
 * parent at index i,
 * left child at index 2i+1 and right child at index 2i+2 for 0-based indexing
